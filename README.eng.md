## caution
When Windows Defender mistakenly recognizes a batch file as a Trojan, this is often called a 'False Positive'. To solve this problem, you can go through the following steps:

1. File exception handling: In Windows Defender, you can set certain files or processes to skip security scanning. To do this, follow the steps below:
   * Click the ‚ÄòStart‚Äô button and go to ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô.
   * Click ‚ÄòUpdate & Security‚Äô.
   * Select ‚ÄòWindows Security‚Äô and go to ‚ÄòVirus & threat protection‚Äô.
   * Click ‚ÄòManage Virus & Threat Protection Settings‚Äô.
   * Select 'Add exception' in 'Virus & threat protection settings'.
   * Select 'File or Folder', find the batch file in question and add it as an exception.
2. Temporarily disable Windows Defender: This may be a temporary solution. However, you must be careful when using this method as it may expose your computer to other threats.
3. Report the problem to anti-virus software: If you are sure that the file is not a Trojan horse, you can report it to Microsoft as a False Positive. Microsoft will review this and take any necessary action.
